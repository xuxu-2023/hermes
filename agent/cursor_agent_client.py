"""OpenAI-compatible facade that forwards Hermes requests to ``cursor-agent``.

This adapter lets Hermes treat the Cursor Agent CLI as a chat-style backend so
every Cursor user (Hobby/Pro/Pro+/Ultra/Teams) can route Hermes calls through
their existing Cursor subscription / API credits.

Per request we spawn ``cursor-agent -p`` with ``--output-format stream-json``,
pass the formatted conversation as the prompt (via stdin to avoid the argv
length limit), then parse the line-delimited JSON events into a single OpenAI
chat-completion response.

Design notes:

- One subprocess per request (no shared long-running session). Warm sessions
  via ``--resume`` are an opt-in path documented below.
- Default ``--mode ask`` keeps Cursor read-only — useful when we just want the
  model as an LLM rather than letting it edit files.
- Default workspace is an ephemeral temp dir so the agent never sees the
  caller's repo. Override via ``HERMES_CURSOR_WORKSPACE`` or the ``workspace``
  ctor arg.
- Tool calls follow the Copilot-ACP convention: tools are described in the
  system prompt and the model emits ``<tool_call>{...}</tool_call>`` blocks
  that we lift back into OpenAI ``tool_calls``.
- The CLI auth (``cursor-agent login`` or ``CURSOR_API_KEY``) is what governs
  identity; we forward ``CURSOR_API_KEY`` to the subprocess and let the CLI
  resolve it (same as the IDE does).

# ``default`` permissionMode (write+shell+everything). We expose that as
# the synthetic ``agent`` value here:
#   - ``ask``   : read-only Q&A. Cursor's built-in mutation tools are
#                 disabled. Hermes-side tools still apply for any work
#                 that needs to touch the user's disk.
#   - ``plan`` : read-only planning mode. Produces structured plan output
#                from Cursor's planner.
#   - ``agent``: omits ``--mode`` so Cursor runs in its IDE-equivalent
#                "default" permissionMode — built-in shell, write, edit,
#                read, etc. all active. Use this when you want Cursor to
#                drive multi-step work end-to-end (it will still emit
#                tool_call events that we surface to Hermes UI).
# Anything else falls back to ``ask``. Don't add new values without

        internal LLM round-trip** in the turn. For an agentic turn that

        (one per tool round plus the final text), and each call's input
