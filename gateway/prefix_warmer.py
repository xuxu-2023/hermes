"""Prompt prefix warmer for local backends.

Local llama.cpp-style servers only reuse cached state when a new request's
rendered prompt shares a byte-identical prefix with a state they still hold —
and on hybrid-SSM models (Qwen3-Next/AgentWorld-class), only when a recurrent
state checkpoint exists at or before the divergence point. In practice this
means the first session after an idle stretch (or after other traffic rotated
the cache) pays a full prefill of the shared prompt prefix — tool schemas plus
the stable system prompt, often 10-20k tokens — even though every session on
that profile sends the identical bytes.

This watcher keeps that shared prefix hot. ``build_api_kwargs`` records the
most recent request the agent sent to each local endpoint (see
``agent/prefix_warm_registry.py``); every ``interval_seconds`` the watcher
replays a minimal request per endpoint:

    messages   = [the captured system message, one fixed "." user turn]
    tools      = the captured tool schemas (rendered into the prompt by the
                 server's chat template, so they must match byte-for-byte)
    extra_body = the captured extra_body (may carry template-affecting
                 options such as chat_template_kwargs)
    max_tokens = 1, temperature = 0

The server therefore keeps a cached state whose prompt is exactly the shared
prefix plus a tiny tail. A fresh session reuses that state up to the point
where its prompt diverges — in practice somewhere inside the system block,
because Hermes appends a volatile tail (memory block, user profile, session
timestamp) after the stable head. The stable head (tool schemas + fixed
system prose) is the bulk of the prefix, so realized reuse is typically most
of the entry tax, not all of it; a memory write or date rollover between
warm and reuse shortens it further. Re-warming a state that is still cached
costs only a few prefill tokens plus one generated token, so the
steady-state overhead is negligible.

To avoid competing with live sessions for cache slots, a warm cycle skips
any endpoint that has seen real traffic within ``min_idle_seconds``: recent
traffic means the prefix is already hot, and on few-slot servers a warm
request landing mid-conversation could otherwise evict an active session's
state (llama.cpp assigns requests to slots by longest-common-prefix, so a
warm request can select — and truncate — a slot holding a live session's
KV). The guard keys off request-build times, so a single generation that
runs longer than ``min_idle_seconds`` can still collide; on servers with a
single parallel slot, prefer leaving the warmer off.

Opt-in via config.yaml (the warmer is pointless for cloud providers, which
manage their own prompt caches):

    prefix_warmer:
      enabled: true
      interval_seconds: 240
      min_idle_seconds: 180
