"""Per-platform slash command access control.

This module sits beside the existing per-platform allowlist (``allow_from``)
and adds a second axis: of the users who are *allowed to talk to the
gateway*, which ones can run *which slash commands*.

Two lists per platform scope (DM vs group, mirroring ``allow_from`` vs
``group_allow_from``):

  - ``allow_admin_from``      — user IDs that get every registered slash
                                command (built-in + plugin-registered).
  - ``user_allowed_commands`` — slash command names non-admin users may
                                run. Empty / unset → non-admins get no
                                slash commands.

Backward compatibility:

  If ``allow_admin_from`` is not set for a scope, slash command gating
  is disabled entirely for that scope. Every allowed user can run every
  slash command, exactly like before. This means existing installs are
  unaffected until an operator opts in by listing at least one admin.

The gate is applied at the slash command dispatch site in
``gateway/run.py`` so it covers BOTH built-in and plugin-registered
commands via the live registry. Gating slash commands does not affect
plain chat — non-admin users can still talk to the agent normally,
they just can't trigger commands outside ``user_allowed_commands``.

Authored as a slimmed-down salvage of PR #4443's permission tiers
(co-authored by @ReqX). The full tier system, audit log, usage
tracking, rate limiting, and tool filtering from that PR are not
included here — only the slash-command access split.

# Slash commands that MUST stay reachable for any allowed user, even when
