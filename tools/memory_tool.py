Memory Tool Module - Persistent Curated Memory

Provides bounded, file-backed memory that persists across sessions. Two stores:
  - MEMORY.md: agent's personal notes and observations (environment facts, project
    conventions, tool quirks, things learned)
  - USER.md: what the agent knows about the user (preferences, communication style,
    expectations, workflow habits)

Both are injected into the system prompt as a frozen snapshot at session start.
Mid-session writes update files on disk immediately (durable) but do NOT change
the system prompt -- this preserves the prefix cache for the entire session.
The snapshot refreshes on the next session start.

Entry delimiter: § (section sign). Entries can be multiline.
Character limits (not tokens) because char counts are model-independent.

Design:
- Single `memory` tool with action parameter: add, replace, remove
- replace/remove use short unique substring matching (not full text or IDs)
- Behavioral guidance lives in the tool schema description
- Frozen snapshot pattern: system prompt is stable, tool responses show live state

# Patterns live in ``tools/threat_patterns.py`` — the single source of truth
# shared with the context-file scanner and the tool-result delimiter system.
# Memory uses the "strict" scope (broadest pattern set) because:
#  - memory entries are user-curated; the user can rewrite a flagged entry
#  - memory enters the system prompt as a FROZEN snapshot, so a poisoned
#    entry persists for the entire session and across sessions until
#    explicitly removed.

        "Save durable facts to persistent memory that survive across sessions. Memory is "
        "injected into every future turn, so keep entries compact and high-signal.\n\n"
        "SIGNAL STRENGTH: Use the 'signal' parameter (float 0.0-1.0) to set an entry's "
        "importance. Higher signal = preserved longer during consolidation when near the "
        "char limit. Default 0.5. Signal + context combine: "
        "save preferences with context='deploy' signal=0.9 for deployment-critical facts.\n\n"
        "CONSOLIDATION: When near the char limit, prune in one batch call: "
        "remove lowest-signal entries, shorten verbose ones, keep high-signal entries. "
        "Signal values guide what to keep vs discard.\n\n"
        "CONTEXT TAGGING: Use the 'context' parameter to tag entries with a workflow type "
        "(e.g. 'deploy', 'feature', 'debug', 'review', 'research', 'planning', 'content', "
        "'maintenance'). Tagged entries are grouped by context in the system prompt so the "
        "agent can prioritise task-relevant memories.\n\n"
        "HOW: make ALL your changes in ONE call via an 'operations' array (each item: "
        "{action, content?, old_text?, context?, signal?}). The batch applies atomically and "
        "the char limit is checked only on the FINAL result — so a single call can remove/replace "

        "The response reports current/limit chars and confirms completion; one batch call "
        "finishes the update, so don't repeat it.\n\n"
