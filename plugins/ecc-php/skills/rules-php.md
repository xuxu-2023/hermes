## Coding Style

# PHP Coding Style

> This file extends [common/coding-style.md](../common/coding-style.md) with PHP specific content.

## Standards

- Follow **PSR-12** formatting and naming conventions.
- Prefer `declare(strict_types=1);` in application code.
- Use scalar type hints, return types, and typed properties everywhere new code permits.

## Immutability

- Prefer immutable DTOs and value objects for data crossing service boundaries.
- Use `readonly` properties or immutable constructors for request/response payloads where possible.
- Keep arrays for simple maps; promote business-critical structures into explicit classes.

## Formatting

- Use **PHP-CS-Fixer** or **Laravel Pint** for formatting.
- Use **PHPStan** or **Psalm** for static analysis.
- Keep Composer scripts checked in so the same commands run locally and in CI.

## Imports

- Add `use` statements for all referenced classes, interfaces, and traits.
- Avoid relying on the global namespace unless the project explicitly prefers fully qualified names.

## Error Handling

- Throw exceptions for exceptional states; avoid returning `false`/`null` as hidden error channels in new code.
- Convert framework/request input into validated DTOs before it reaches domain logic.

## Reference

See skill: `backend-patterns` for broader service/repository layering guidance.

## Hooks

# PHP Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with PHP specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **Pint / PHP-CS-Fixer**: Auto-format edited `.php` files.
- **PHPStan / Psalm**: Run static analysis after PHP edits in typed codebases.
- **PHPUnit / Pest**: Run targeted tests for touched files or modules when edits affect behavior.

## Warnings

- Warn on `var_dump`, `dd`, `dump`, or `die()` left in edited files.
- Warn when edited PHP files add raw SQL or disable CSRF/session protections.

## Patterns

# PHP Patterns

> This file extends [common/patterns.md](../common/patterns.md) with PHP specific content.

## Thin Controllers, Explicit Services

- Keep controllers focused on transport: auth, validation, serialization, status codes.
- Move business rules into application/domain services that are easy to test without HTTP bootstrapping.

## DTOs and Value Objects

- Replace shape-heavy associative arrays with DTOs for requests, commands, and external API payloads.
- Use value objects for money, identifiers, date ranges, and other constrained concepts.

## Dependency Injection

- Depend on interfaces or narrow service contracts, not framework globals.
- Pass collaborators through constructors so services are testable without service-locator lookups.

## Boundaries

- Isolate ORM models from domain decisions when the model layer is doing more than persistence.
- Wrap third-party SDKs behind small adapters so the rest of the codebase depends on your contract, not theirs.

## Reference

See skill: `api-design` for endpoint conventions and response-shape guidance.
See skill: `laravel-patterns` for Laravel-specific architecture guidance.

## Security

# PHP Security

> This file extends [common/security.md](../common/security.md) with PHP specific content.

## Input and Output

- Validate request input at the framework boundary (`FormRequest`, Symfony Validator, or explicit DTO validation).
- Escape output in templates by default; treat raw HTML rendering as an exception that must be justified.
- Never trust query params, cookies, headers, or uploaded file metadata without validation.

## Database Safety

- Use prepared statements (`PDO`, Doctrine, Eloquent query builder) for all dynamic queries.
- Avoid string-building SQL in controllers/views.
- Scope ORM mass-assignment carefully and whitelist writable fields.

## Secrets and Dependencies

- Load secrets from environment variables or a secret manager, never from committed config files.
- Run `composer audit` in CI and review new package maintainer trust before adding dependencies.
- Pin major versions deliberately and remove abandoned packages quickly.

## Auth and Session Safety

- Use `password_hash()` / `password_verify()` for password storage.
- Regenerate session identifiers after authentication and privilege changes.
- Enforce CSRF protection on state-changing web requests.

## Reference

See skill: `laravel-security` for Laravel-specific security guidance.

## Testing

# PHP Testing

> This file extends [common/testing.md](../common/testing.md) with PHP specific content.

## Framework

Use **PHPUnit** as the default test framework. If **Pest** is configured in the project, prefer Pest for new tests and avoid mixing frameworks.

## Coverage

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
# or
vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

Prefer **pcov** or **Xdebug** in CI, and keep coverage thresholds in CI rather than as tribal knowledge.

## Test Organization

- Separate fast unit tests from framework/database integration tests.
- Use factory/builders for fixtures instead of large hand-written arrays.
- Keep HTTP/controller tests focused on transport and validation; move business rules into service-level tests.

## Inertia

If the project uses Inertia.js, prefer `assertInertia` with `AssertableInertia` to verify component names and props instead of raw JSON assertions.
