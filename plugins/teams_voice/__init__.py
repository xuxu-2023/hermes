"""teams_voice plugin — Microsoft Teams real-time voice/video (CVI) bridge driver.

Hosts an HMAC-authenticated WebSocket the companion Windows .NET media worker
dials into, and drives the call: dialogue (realtime
or streaming), perception (camera/screen vision), and the avatar rendering cues
(expression / visemes / show-to-caller). The worker renders the NV12 avatar tile;
this plugin sends the drivers.

Chat-plane integration (Teams messages, message actions, meeting-recap posting)
is handled by the existing ``plugins/platforms/teams`` adapter — this plugin is
the *media/voice* half and deliberately does not duplicate it.

Status: implemented. Realtime (OpenAI/Azure speech-to-speech) and streaming
(STT->agent->TTS) call modes; vision, tools (consult/agent_task/look_at_screen/
show_to_caller/call_me_back/post_meeting_minutes), group gate, verbal interrupts,
DTMF, bilingual, meeting recap. The Windows .NET media worker renders the avatar.
