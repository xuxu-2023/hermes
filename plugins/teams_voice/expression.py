"""Avatar emotion heuristic.

A cheap, dependency-free lexical classifier that infers a coarse emotion from the
assistant's reply text, with no extra model call. The result is sent to the media
worker as an additive ``expression`` cue so the avatar shapes its mouth
(smile / frown / round "O"). Best-effort and purely cosmetic.

Priority order matters: surprise > sad > happy > neutral (a "!" plus a sad word
should read as surprise, matching the original).
