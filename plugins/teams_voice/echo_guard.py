"""Echo guard — stop the realtime model answering its own playback.

The realtime self-answer bug: on a speakerphone
the bot's own audio loops back into the mic, the model's VAD hears it, and it
"replies" to itself. This guard decides, per inbound caller frame, whether to
forward it to the model.

Logic:

* Keep a **playout clock** — an estimate of when our outbound audio finishes. The
  model streams faster than realtime, so wall-clock send time != play time; we
  accumulate sent-frame durations instead.
* While we're "speaking" (now < playout_end + tail window), inbound audio is
  **dropped unless it is loud enough to be a real barge-in** (RMS >= threshold).
* **Until the caller's first real turn**, allow *no* barge-in at all — so the
  opening greeting echoing back can't make the bot interrupt and re-greet itself
  in a loop while the caller is silent.

Pure logic with an injectable clock so it is unit-testable.
