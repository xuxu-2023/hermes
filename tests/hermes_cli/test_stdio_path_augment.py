"""Tests for hermes_cli.stdio._augment_path_with_known_tools.

On Windows, the installer (scripts/install.ps1) persists its managed tool
directories to the *User* PATH, but that broadcast does not reach the
already-running shell the user launches ``hermes`` from. To smooth over that
first-launch gap, ``_augment_path_with_known_tools`` prepends the known
Hermes-managed tool directories to the current process PATH so spawned
subprocesses resolve them immediately.

These tests force the Windows branch headlessly and assert the managed Node
directory (``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\hermes\\node``) is one of the mirrored entries —
it is persisted to the User PATH by Install-Node exactly like the Git dirs.
