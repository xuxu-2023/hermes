"""Tests for ``_format_acp_import_error`` — the helper that turns
ImportError raised during ``hermes acp`` startup into user-facing messages.

Regression coverage for issue #24959: a fresh hermes install (with a
pre-existing ``marker-pdf`` in the same env that conflicts with the
project's openai pin) reported "ACP dependencies not installed" even
when the actual import failure was elsewhere, sending users in circles
reinstalling the ``[acp]`` extra.
