"""Tests for AIAgent._repair_tool_call — tool-name normalization.

Regression guard for #14784: Claude-style models sometimes emit
class-like tool-call names (``TodoTool_tool``, ``Patch_tool``,
``BrowserClick_tool``, ``PatchTool``). Before the fix they returned
"Unknown tool" even though the target tool was registered under a
snake_case name. The repair routine now normalizes CamelCase,
strips trailing ``_tool`` / ``-tool`` / ``tool`` suffixes (up to
twice to handle double-tacked suffixes like ``TodoTool_tool``), and
falls back to fuzzy match.

BUG-8 regression guard: the namespace-prefix guard (step 6) prevents
a shared ``kb_`` / ``mcp_knowledge_kb_`` prefix from inflating the
SequenceMatcher ratio enough to allow silent read-to-write repairs
(e.g. ``kb_search`` -> ``kb_add``).
