# Docker Compose Smoke Test

Use this skill for local stack validation after install changes, deployment-wrapper changes, or fork sync work.

## Read First

- [docker-compose.yml](../../../docker-compose.yml)
- [docker-compose.upstream.yml](../../../docker-compose.upstream.yml)
- [INSTALL.md](../../../INSTALL.md)
- [docker/hermes-env.example](../../../docker/hermes-env.example)
- [docker/hermes-config.yaml](../../../docker/hermes-config.yaml)
- [docker/entrypoint.sh](../../../docker/entrypoint.sh) when startup behavior or entrypoint drift is relevant

## When to Use

- Install or refresh Hermes from `nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest` without rebuilding locally.
- Confirm that `hermes-web`, `hermes-gateway`, and `postgres` start correctly.
- Debug a failed local bring-up.
- Verify that the stack is usable before pushing a fork update.
- Keep the existing local env file, config mounts, and host ports while refreshing the published upstream image through the fork wrapper.

## Procedure

### 1. Check prerequisites and environment

- On Windows, prefer WSL2-oriented workflows because the main README does not treat native Windows as the supported runtime path.
- Confirm Docker Engine and Docker Compose are available before changing files or starting containers.
- Treat `data/.env` and generated `data/config.yaml` as local runtime state, not committed source.
- Preserve the host-port contract from the compose files: `9119`, `8789`, `8644`, and `5433` should stay unchanged unless the user explicitly asks for different ports.

### 2. Seed the local env file if needed

Use the repo-documented layout:

```bash
mkdir -p data
cp docker/hermes-env.example data/.env
```

If `data/.env` already exists, inspect it before replacing it.

### 3. Choose the compose path before starting containers

Default to the documented fork deployment wrapper:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml up -d --pull always --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

Use this path for install validation, upstream-sync review, or runtime checks against the published container image while keeping the fork's wrapper behavior intact. It keeps the same `./data` mount, `data/.env`, generated `data/config.yaml`, host ports, and fork-local `docker/hermes-config.yaml` surface while pulling `nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest`.

If the user explicitly wants to compare against older automation that still passes `-f docker-compose.upstream.yml`, use [docker-compose.upstream.yml](../../../docker-compose.upstream.yml):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml up -d --pull always --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

Use this path for install validation, upstream-sync review, or runtime checks against the published container image. It keeps the same `./data` mount, `data/.env`, generated `data/config.yaml`, and host ports while recreating the services from `nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest` or a pinned `HERMES_UPSTREAM_IMAGE`.

Use the local-build stack only when fork code, the Dockerfile, or other in-repo image contents are under test:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Start the stack

Use the command that matches the chosen compose path.

This should start:

- `hermes-web` on `:9119`
- `hermes-gateway` running the gateway with the `weixin` (WeChat personal) platform enabled — no host port, outbound long-poll only
- `postgres` on host port `5433`

### 5. Check status and logs

Use targeted inspection before escalating:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 hermes-web
docker compose logs --tail=100 hermes-gateway
docker compose logs --tail=100 postgres
```

If the pull-only stack is active, add `-f docker-compose.upstream.yml` consistently to the same commands.

Focus on:

- healthcheck failures;
- config bootstrap problems or entrypoint drift when startup behavior is under discussion;
- missing env vars or permission errors;
- port binding conflicts;
- WeChat gateway stuck on first poll — verify `data/weixin/accounts/` exists and contains a JSON credential file. If empty, run the wizard (the `setup` subcommand opens a menu — select `Weixin / WeChat`, item 13):
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml run --rm hermes-gateway \
      hermes gateway setup
  ```

### 6. Smoke test the running stack

Validate these expectations:

- `http://127.0.0.1:9119/api/status` returns a healthy status for the web UI.
- `hermes-gateway` logs show a successful iLink `getupdates` long-poll connection (no host port to probe directly).
- `postgres` reports healthy in `docker compose ps`.
- `docker exec -it hermes-web hermes` is the documented interactive smoke test when an interactive shell is appropriate.

#### 6a. WeChat channel smoke test (no HTTP port to probe)

The weixin adapter uses outbound long-poll to Tencent iLink — there is no host port to `curl`. Use this four-level sequence instead, cheapest first.

**Level 1 — Container healthcheck (5s).** The compose healthcheck probes for `data/weixin/accounts/` directory existence. If `healthy`, the wizard has run at least once.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml ps
# hermes-gateway state should be "healthy" (or "Up" if healthcheck is still pending)
```

If state is `Up` but not `healthy`, the wizard has not been run yet — run it (the `setup` subcommand opens a menu — select `Weixin / WeChat`, item 13):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml run --rm hermes-gateway \
    hermes gateway setup
```

**Level 2 — Adapter connected log (10-30s).** The weixin adapter logs a specific line when its long-poll loop is up. This is the canonical "channel is alive" signal.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml logs --tail=200 hermes-gateway 2>&1 \
    | grep -E "Connected|Disconnected"
```

Success looks like:

```
hermes-gateway  | [weixin] Connected account=<id> base=https://ilinkai.weixin.qq.com
```

That line is emitted at [gateway/platforms/weixin.py:1297](gateway/platforms/weixin.py#L1297). No `Disconnected` line should follow.

Failure modes:

- `getUpdates failed ret=-14 errcode=-14 errmsg=session expired` — iLink session expired; re-run the wizard.
- `getUpdates failed ret=-2 errmsg=unknown error` — stale-session signal (same as `-14`); re-run the wizard.
- `Session expired; pausing for 10 minutes` — same root cause; wizard re-run required.
- `Connected` then `Disconnected` — token lock conflict (another profile is using the same bot). Stop the other profile, restart.

**Level 3 — Gateway status CLI (instant).** Reports running gateway PIDs and platform state. Useful when logs are ambiguous.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml exec hermes-gateway hermes gateway status
```

**Level 4 — End-to-end inbound (the real proof).** This is the only test that proves the channel actually delivers messages.

```bash
# 1. Tail the gateway log
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml logs -f hermes-gateway 2>&1 \
    | grep -E "inbound|Connected|Disconnected"

# 2. From your phone, send "ping" to the WeChat account you scanned with

# 3. Expected within ~2 seconds:
#    [weixin] inbound from=<sender_id> type=direct media=0

# 4. Confirm a session file was created:
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml exec hermes-web ls -la /opt/data/sessions/ | tail -5
# Look for a new .json file with recent mtime
```

The `inbound from=` line is emitted at [gateway/platforms/weixin.py:1466](gateway/platforms/weixin.py#L1466).

**One-shot script (all four levels in one command):**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml ps && \
echo "--- adapter connected? ---" && \
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml logs --tail=200 hermes-gateway 2>&1 \
    | grep -E "Connected|Disconnected" | tail -3 && \
echo "--- gateway status ---" && \
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml exec hermes-gateway hermes gateway status && \
echo "--- recent sessions (send a test message from WeChat first) ---" && \
docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml exec hermes-web ls -la /opt/data/sessions/ | tail -3
```

**Common failure → fix table:**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Container `Exit 1` immediately | `data/weixin/accounts/` doesn't exist | Run the wizard |
| Container `Up` but not `healthy` | Wizard hasn't run yet | Run the wizard |
| `Connected` then `Disconnected` | Token lock conflict (another profile using same bot) | Stop other profile, restart |
| `getUpdates failed ret=-14` | iLink session expired | Re-run wizard |
| `getUpdates failed ret=-2 errmsg=unknown error` | Stale session signal | Re-run wizard |
| `Connected` but no `inbound` after sending message | WeChat side didn't deliver (iLink bot not in your contacts) | Add the bot as a contact in WeChat first |
| `inbound` appears but no session file | Agent crashed mid-processing | Check `docker compose logs hermes-gateway` for stack traces |

### 7. Shut down safely when needed

Non-destructive stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If the pull-only stack is active, add `-f docker-compose.upstream.yml` consistently here too.

Destructive reset:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Do not use the destructive reset unless the user clearly wants volumes and persisted state removed.

## Guardrails

- Prefer repo-documented commands from [INSTALL.md](../../../INSTALL.md) over improvised alternatives.
- Do not overwrite an existing `data/.env` without checking whether it contains local secrets.
- Default to [docker-compose.yml](../../../docker-compose.yml) for routine no-build install or runtime validation of this fork's wrapper path.
- Use [docker-compose.upstream.yml](../../../docker-compose.upstream.yml) only when the user explicitly wants to compare behavior with older automation that still invokes that compatibility file.
- Keep the same local env mounts and ports when moving between wrapper validation and raw-upstream comparison; do not introduce alternate host ports unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- If the stack fails because Ollama or another external dependency is unavailable, report that as an environment blocker rather than guessing at code changes.
- When the stack comes up on a fork, remember that upstream Docker publish CI does not validate the fork automatically.

## Expected Output Shape

1. what was started or skipped;
2. container status summary;
3. health/log findings by service;
4. next action or blocker.
