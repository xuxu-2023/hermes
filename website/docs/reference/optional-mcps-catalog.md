# Optional MCPs Catalog

Optional MCP servers ship with hermes-agent under `optional-mcps/` but are **not active by default**. They are discovered through `hermes mcp catalog` and activated explicitly with `hermes mcp install <name>`.

Presence in `optional-mcps/` is the trust signal: an entry is in the catalog only because a maintainer merged a PR adding it. There is no community tier and no automatic refresh — the manifest you see is the manifest you get until you re-run `hermes mcp install` after a repo update.

## CLI usage

```bash
hermes mcp                  # interactive picker (TUI) — toggle entries on/off
hermes mcp catalog          # plain-text list of Nous-approved entries (scriptable)
hermes mcp install <name>   # install a catalog entry by name (prompts for env/OAuth)
hermes mcp uninstall <name> # remove the server's config block (.env credentials are preserved)
```

`hermes mcp install` writes a `mcp_servers.<name>` block into `~/.hermes/config.yaml` using the manifest's `transport:` keys, runs any `install:` bootstrap (e.g. `git clone` + `pip install`), and prompts for any `auth:` env vars defined by the manifest. Secrets go to `~/.hermes/.env`; non-secret env vars also land in `.env` to keep one credential store.

For the general MCP config shape (independent of the catalog), see the [MCP Config Reference](/reference/mcp-config-reference). For the conceptual overview, see [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/user-guide/features/mcp).

## Catalog entries

| Name | Transport | Auth | Source | Description |
|------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| [**linear**](https://linear.app/docs/mcp) | http (remote) | oauth (native MCP) | [linear.app/docs/mcp](https://linear.app/docs/mcp) | Find, create, and update Linear issues, projects, and comments. |
| [**n8n**](https://github.com/CyberSamuraiX/hermes-n8n-mcp) | stdio | api_key | [CyberSamuraiX/hermes-n8n-mcp](https://github.com/CyberSamuraiX/hermes-n8n-mcp) | Manage and inspect n8n workflows from Hermes (stdio bridge, no public port). |

## Trust model

The catalog policy is intentionally narrow, and is enforced at the directory level rather than via metadata:

- **Approval is a merged PR.** Entries are added only by merging a PR into hermes-agent. Presence in the `optional-mcps/` directory equals Nous approval. There is no community tier and no trust signals beyond "it's in the catalog".
- **Manifests pin transport details.** Each manifest fixes the command, args, install URL, and git ref. MCPs are never auto-updated — users re-run `hermes mcp install <name>` explicitly to pull a new manifest version after a repo update.
- **Secrets live in `~/.hermes/.env`.** Env vars prompted at install time go to `~/.hermes/.env` (the .env-is-for-secrets rule). Non-secret env vars also go to `.env` so there is one credential store.
- **Default tool surface is conservative.** When an entry specifies `tools.default_enabled`, the install-time checklist pre-prunes mutating or rarely-useful tools — users opt in to the full surface per their threat model.

## How to add a new entry

To propose a new optional MCP:

1. Add a directory under `optional-mcps/<name>/` containing a `manifest.yaml`.
2. Use the existing entries (`optional-mcps/linear/manifest.yaml`, `optional-mcps/n8n/manifest.yaml`) as templates. They cover the two supported transports (HTTP with native MCP OAuth; stdio with git-clone install).
3. Set `manifest_version: 1` — the current schema version constant in `hermes_cli/mcp_catalog.py`. Manifests with a higher version than the running CLI are skipped, so bumping the version is a coordinated change with the catalog loader.
4. Submit a PR. Maintainers review transport, auth, default tool surface, and source provenance. Once merged, the entry appears in `hermes mcp catalog` and in this reference page.

See [Contributing](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the general PR workflow.

## Per-entry details

The manifests below are the source of truth. They are read verbatim at install time by `hermes_cli/mcp_catalog.py`.

### linear

Remote MCP server with native OAuth 2.1 + Dynamic Client Registration over Streamable HTTP. Hermes's MCP client and `mcp_oauth_manager` handle discovery, PKCE, token exchange, and refresh — nothing is installed locally.

```yaml
# Nous-approved MCP catalog entry.
# Presence in this directory = approval. Merged via PR review.
manifest_version: 1

name: linear
description: Find, create, and update Linear issues, projects, and comments.
source: https://linear.app/docs/mcp

# Linear ships a remote MCP server with native OAuth 2.1 + Dynamic Client
# Registration over Streamable HTTP. Hermes's MCP client + mcp_oauth_manager
# handle discovery, PKCE, token exchange, and refresh — nothing to install
# locally.
transport:
  type: http
  url: https://mcp.linear.app/mcp

auth:
  type: oauth
  # No `provider:` — this is native MCP OAuth (case 1), not a third-party
  # provider like Google. The MCP client triggers the browser flow on the
  # first probe / first connect.

# Tool selection at install time:
# Linear's MCP server exposes a moderate-sized tool surface (find/get/list +
# create/update across issues/projects/comments). We leave `default_enabled`
# unset so the install-time checklist starts with everything pre-checked —
# users prune what they don't want.
#
# If you want to encode a curated subset here once it stabilizes, list the
# tool names under `tools.default_enabled`. Probe failure would then apply
# that list directly.

post_install: |
  On first connection, Hermes will open a browser to authenticate with Linear.
  After auth, restart your Hermes session so the Linear tools are loaded.

  You can re-run the tool checklist any time with:
    hermes mcp configure linear
```

### n8n

stdio bridge to a running n8n instance. The catalog clones the bridge repo into a hermes-managed install directory, sets up a venv, and prompts for the n8n base URL and API key. The default tool surface is read-mostly — mutating tools (`activate_workflow`, `deactivate_workflow`, docker `container_logs`) are pruned from the install-time checklist but users can opt in.

```yaml
# Nous-approved MCP catalog entry.
# Presence in this directory = approval. Merged via PR review.
#
# Schema version 1.
manifest_version: 1

name: n8n
description: Manage and inspect n8n workflows from Hermes (stdio bridge, no public port).
source: https://github.com/CyberSamuraiX/hermes-n8n-mcp

# How to launch the server once installed. The keys here map 1:1 to the
# `mcp_servers.<name>` block written into ~/.hermes/config.yaml by the
# existing `_save_mcp_server()` helper in hermes_cli/mcp_config.py.
transport:
  type: stdio
  # For git-installed servers, ${INSTALL_DIR} is substituted at install time
  # with the path the catalog cloned the repo into. The catalog never
  # auto-updates: the user re-runs `hermes mcp install official/n8n` to
  # refresh.
  command: "${INSTALL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python"
  args:
    - "${INSTALL_DIR}/server.py"

# Optional install step. Omit for npm/uvx servers where transport.command
# is the install (`npx -y package`). Use for repos that need a local clone
# + dependency install.
install:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/CyberSamuraiX/hermes-n8n-mcp.git
  # Pin to a commit/tag. Required — manifests do not float HEAD.
  ref: main
  # Bootstrap commands run inside the cloned directory after clone.
  bootstrap:
    - "python3 -m venv .venv"
    - ".venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Authentication. Three shapes:
#   type: api_key  — prompt for env vars, write to ~/.hermes/.env
#   type: oauth    — provider-mediated or remote MCP native OAuth (case 1/2)
#   type: none     — no credentials needed
auth:
  type: api_key
  env:
    - name: N8N_BASE_URL
      prompt: "n8n instance URL"
      default: "http://127.0.0.1:5678"
      required: true
      secret: false
    - name: N8N_API_KEY
      prompt: "n8n API key (generate under Settings → API)"
      required: true
      secret: true

# Tool selection at install time:
# n8n's bridge exposes 11 tools. Mutating ones (activate/deactivate, docker
# container_logs) are pruned from the default so a user who installs casually
# gets a read-mostly safe surface. Users see the full list in the install-time
# checklist and can opt into the mutating tools per their threat model.
tools:
  default_enabled:
    - health
    - list_workflows
    - get_workflow
    - find_workflows
    - list_executions
    - get_execution
    - recent_failures
    - export_workflow

post_install: |
  The n8n bridge expects to talk to a running n8n instance over the URL you
  provided. Generate an API key in n8n under Settings → API.

  Workflow activate/deactivate calls are real mutations against your live n8n.
  Treat them carefully.

  Start a new Hermes session to load the n8n tools.
```
