# Sally Skills

[Sally Skills](https://github.com/Sally-A1C/ai-sally-skills) is a metered Model Context Protocol server that exposes the clinical-grade metabolic-health intelligence behind the A1C Insights iOS app to AI agents. One bearer key, six skills, pay-per-call in USD, no subscription.

Connect it through Hermes' native MCP client and the six skills appear alongside built-in tools like `terminal` and `read_file`. The agent's LLM picks the right one for each user request: pulling wearable data, interpreting a lab PDF, scoring a meal photo, generating a daily readout, or answering a preventive-health question.

## When to Use

Use this whenever a conversation needs grounded health context:

- The user wants their CGM, sleep, vitals, or activity in the agent's context.
- A lab PDF or image needs OCR plus clinical interpretation.
- A meal photo needs macro analysis and glucose-spike prediction.
- The user asks for a morning, afternoon, or evening health readout.
- A 30-day metabolic snapshot (time-in-range, variability, dawn phenomenon) is useful.
- A preventive-health or Traditional Chinese Medicine question needs evidence-graded answers with source citations.

Do not use this skill for diagnosis or treatment decisions. Sally Skills returns clinical signals and reference ranges, not medical advice.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the A1C Insights iOS app: <https://apps.apple.com/id/app/a1c-insights/id6748399956>
2. Create an account and sync at least one data source (Apple Health, a wearable, or a CGM).
3. Sign in to the developer console at <https://console.a1c.io> with the same email.
4. Open **API Keys**, click **Create new key**, copy the `sk-sally-…` value (shown only once).
5. Top up the wallet at <https://console.a1c.io/billing> for paid skills. `health_sync` is free and needs no top-up.

## How to Run

Hermes auto-discovers MCP servers configured in `mcp.json`. Add Sally Skills:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sally": {
      "url": "https://sally.a1c.io/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk-sally-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Hermes. The six skills appear as first-class tools in every conversation.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Cost / call | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `health_sync` | FREE | 64+ daily biomarkers from wearables, CGM, sleep, vitals, activity, environment. |
| `chat_with_sally` | $0.003 | Preventive-health and TCM Q&A with source citations. |
| `analyze_lab_result` | $0.008 | Parsed lab panel (lipid, HbA1c, CBC, thyroid, hormone, micronutrient) with risk flags and ADA / ACC / ESC guideline context. |
| `food_journal` | $0.004 | Meal photo to macros, glucose-spike prediction, Smart vs Trap categorisation. |
| `health_insights` | $0.003 | Morning, afternoon, or evening readout from the user's last day. |
| `metabolic_overview` | $0.005 | CGM time-in-range, glycemic variability, dawn phenomenon, postprandial response curves. |

## Procedure

A typical multi-skill conversation looks like:

1. User: "How was my morning?"
2. Hermes calls `health_insights` with `{ window: "morning" }`.
3. Sally returns a structured readout (sleep score, HRV, resting heart rate, morning glucose, hydration, narrative).
4. User: "What should I eat for breakfast?"
5. Hermes calls `chat_with_sally` with the readout as context.
6. Sally returns three TCM-aligned meal options with rationale and source citations.
7. User photographs the chosen meal.
8. Hermes calls `food_journal` with the inline image.
9. Sally grades the meal and predicts the glucose spike based on the user's recent metabolic_overview.

Chain length is bounded by the user's wallet; every `tools/call` decrements the balance per skill price.

## Pitfalls

- **Lab PDFs and meal photos are not persisted by Sally.** They flow agent to gateway to AI service to response, with no S3 or GCS upload. If your agent caches the request, that cache is the only copy.
- **`metabolic_overview` requires an active CGM** paired in the A1C Insights app. Without one it returns `404 not_found` rather than synthesising glucose values.
- **`402 payment_required`** is the wallet-empty signal. Surface a top-up link to <https://console.a1c.io/billing> instead of retrying.
- **The bearer key is the identity.** Sally never accepts `user_uuid` or `email` in the request body. Sharing one key across multiple human users mixes their data; mint one key per agent or device instead.

## Verification

After configuring `mcp.json` and restarting Hermes, run:

```bash
hermes tools/list | grep ^sally
```

You should see six `sally.*` tools listed. To smoke-test the free skill from the terminal:

```bash
curl -sS https://sally.a1c.io/v1/call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-sally-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"skill":"health_sync","input":{}}' | jq .ok
# → true
```

A `true` response means the key resolves to your A1C account and `health_sync` is callable. Agents can now call the same skill via MCP.
