# crabbox.sh — Hermes Orchestration Guide

**crabbox.sh** is a single-file Hermes skill *and* CLI wrapper. Reading the file gives you the skill documentation; executing it drives a cloud sandbox backend. One artifact, one path, one install.

`crabbox.sh` itself does no networking — it normalizes a small set of verbs and forwards to the backend selected by `CRABBOX_BACKEND` (default `islo`). Different backends spell their verbs differently and have different capabilities, so the wrapper maps the workhorse verbs (`new`/`list`/`rm`) and gates capability-specific flags. **Run `./crabbox.sh backends` to see what's wired in and `./crabbox.sh schema <cmd>` for the live flag surface.**

## Backends

| Backend | Paradigm | `new`→ / `rm`→ | box addressing | json flag | agent→PR? | `schema`? | Install |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **islo** (default) | Provision a hardware-isolated microVM, clone a repo, run `claude`/`cursor` against `--task`, **return a PR**. | `use` / `rm` | positional NAME | `--output json` | ✅ yes | ✅ yes | `curl -fsSL https://islo.dev/install.sh \| sh` then `islo login` |
| **crabbox** ([openclaw/crabbox](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox)) | "Warm a box, sync the diff, run the suite": rsync your dirty checkout to a leased box, run a command remotely, stream output, release. **No autonomous agent.** | `run` / `stop` | `--id NAME` (lease-id or slug); **never positional** | `--json` (per-command) | ❌ no | ❌ no (stubbed) | `brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox` ([crabbox.sh](https://crabbox.sh)) |

**Box addressing differs by backend.** islo takes the box name **positionally**; crabbox addresses every single-box verb by **`--id NAME`** (the canonical `cbx_…` lease id *or* the friendly slug) — the wrapper injects `--id` for you on `new`(reuse)/`status`/`rm`(→`stop`)/`pause`/`resume`/`stop`/`ssh`/`share`/`ports`. It never lands the name in a positional slot, because for `crabbox run` the positional/trailing argv is the **remote command**.

**Removal semantics (crabbox).** `crabbox.sh rm NAME` maps to **`crabbox stop --id NAME`** — the correct single-lease teardown (release/delete the machine for direct/coordinator providers, tear down delegated sandboxes, or drop the local claim for static `provider=ssh`). `release` is a confirmed compat alias for `stop`. It is **never** mapped to `crabbox cleanup`: cleanup is a fleet-wide GC *sweep* that enumerates owned direct-provider machines by label, takes **no** per-box id, and **refuses** when a coordinator is configured.

**Ephemeral vs persistent (crabbox).** `crabbox run` **without** `--id` creates a fresh non-kept lease that **auto-releases when the command exits** — so a bare `new` is naturally one-shot. To create a **durable, reusable named box**, use `crabbox warmup --slug NAME` (warmup keeps the lease) or `crabbox run --keep --slug NAME`. `--slug` only names a *fresh* lease; reuse an existing one via `--id`.

**Pick by the work, not by the brand.** Use **islo** when you want a machine to go off and *produce a PR on its own* (Patterns 1–3). Use **openclaw/crabbox** when *you* hold the diff and want cloud-grade compute for the edit-save-run loop — running a heavy suite, reproducing a flake on a "beast" box, or testing a PR with `--fresh-pr` (Pattern 8). Patterns that pass `--agent`/`--task` require an **agent-capable** backend; crabbox.sh refuses those flags on a non-agent backend with a clear message instead of silently producing nothing.

**Other backends.** Any CLI works if you teach `load_backend` its verb names: add a `case` arm declaring its `new`/`list`/`rm` spellings and whether it has agent/schema support. Unknown backends are assumed islo-style.

**Mental model.** Hermes's `delegate_task` spawns *in-process* children that share the parent's container. `crabbox.sh new` (islo backend) spawns *isolated sandboxes* with their own kernel and an agent inside. Reach for an islo sandbox when work is heavy enough to deserve its own machine, parallel enough to deserve fan-out, cross-repo enough that one Hermes session shouldn't try, or **untrusted enough** that hardware isolation matters (running model-generated code, evaluating third-party agents, executing diffs from external contributors). Reach for crabbox when you already have the change and just need a bigger/cleaner box to run it on.

**Platforms.** macOS and Linux (Windows users: run inside WSL2). The wrapper is portable shell; the backend's CLI talks to its own service.

## Discovery and invocation

- **Path:** `optional-skills/autonomous-ai-agents/crabbox/crabbox.sh`
- **Self-describe:** `./crabbox.sh skill` prints this whole document, frontmatter included.
- **Backends:** `./crabbox.sh backends` lists wired-in backends, their verb maps, and capabilities.
- **Help:** `./crabbox.sh help` lists subcommands and global flags.
- **Schema (machine-readable):** `./crabbox.sh schema [COMMAND]` defers to the backend's own schema (islo). **crabbox is NOT schema-capable** — there is no schema/introspect/completion verb, so the wrapper stubs `schema` for crabbox and points you at the only machine-discovery surfaces: per-command `--json`, `crabbox providers --json`, and `crabbox config show --json`. **Hermes should call `./crabbox.sh schema <cmd>` before composing any invocation it isn't certain about** — the backend CLI is the source of truth, not this skill.

## Prerequisites

- **Install crabbox.sh:** copy `optional-skills/autonomous-ai-agents/crabbox/crabbox.sh` somewhere on PATH and `chmod +x`. No runtime deps beyond a shell and the configured backend.
- **Install a backend:** see the table above. Default `islo`: `curl -fsSL https://islo.dev/install.sh | sh`, then `islo login` (browser OAuth; tokens go to the OS keychain, falling back to `~/.islo/auth.json`). Swap with `export CRABBOX_BACKEND=crabbox`.
- **`gh` CLI:** required for parsing GitHub URLs and polling for PRs (`gh auth status`).
- **Verify:** `./crabbox.sh doctor` (backend health) and `./crabbox.sh status` (auth + config + sandbox state).
- **Project config (one-time per repo):** `./crabbox.sh init`.

## CLI Surface

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `crabbox.sh skill` | Print the full skill markdown (this document) |
| `crabbox.sh backends` | List wired-in backends, verb maps, and capabilities |
| `crabbox.sh help` | Subcommand index and global flags |
| `crabbox.sh version` | crabbox.sh version + active backend |
| `crabbox.sh login [--tool ...]` | Authenticate or connect an integration |
| `crabbox.sh logout [--tool ...]` | Clear credentials or disconnect an integration |
| `crabbox.sh init` | Setup wizard — create backend config, detect tools |
| `crabbox.sh add [TOOL]` | Add setup scripts (interactive detection if no tool given) |
| `crabbox.sh new NAME [flags] [-- COMMAND]` | Lease/use a box; shell, exec, or (islo) run an agent (the workhorse) |
| `crabbox.sh list` | List boxes/sandboxes |
| `crabbox.sh status [NAME]` | Show auth/config status, or detailed box state |
| `crabbox.sh pause NAME` | Snapshot state, free resources |
| `crabbox.sh resume NAME` | Resume a paused box |
| `crabbox.sh stop NAME` | Stop a running box without removing it |
| `crabbox.sh rm NAME -f` | Remove ONE box (islo `rm NAME` / crabbox `stop --id NAME`; no recycle bin; wildcard-guarded) |
| `crabbox.sh logs NAME [...]` | Investigate logs by mode (islo: box logs; **crabbox: RUN id `run_<hex>`, not a box name**) |
| `crabbox.sh doctor` | Backend system health check |
| `crabbox.sh ssh NAME` | SSH into the box |
| `crabbox.sh share / ports / snapshot ...` | Passthrough to backend (verb spelling is backend-specific) |
| `crabbox.sh schema [COMMAND]` | Machine-readable backend schema, or `--help` fallback |
| `crabbox.sh update` | Update the backend CLI |

`crabbox.sh` normalizes the workhorse verbs (`new`/`list`/`rm`), the `schema` capability, and **box addressing** across backends; everything else forwards verbatim, so a verb a given backend doesn't have will surface that backend's own error. **Box addressing:** for crabbox the wrapper binds the box NAME to `--id NAME` on every single-box verb (`new`(reuse)/`status`/`rm`→`stop`/`pause`/`resume`/`stop`/`ssh`/`share`/`ports`); for islo the name stays positional. `logs` is exempt on crabbox (it takes a run id, not a box).

**Global flags** pass through unchanged. **JSON output differs by backend:** islo honors a global `--output {table,json,plain}`; crabbox has **no** global JSON — it uses a **per-command `--json`** appended *after* the subcommand and positionals (supported on `status`, `list`, `inspect`, `ports`, `doctor`, `providers`, `logs`, `events`, `results`, `history`). The wrapper does **not** force-inject `--json`; pass it yourself when you need machine output. **From Hermes, prefer machine-readable output** (`--output json` on islo, `--json` on crabbox) when consuming results programmatically.

## The `crabbox.sh new` workhorse

`crabbox.sh new NAME` maps to the backend's lease/run verb (`islo use` / `crabbox run`). What it does depends on the flags and the backend.

```bash
# Exec a one-shot command (preferred for Hermes — exit code is parseable; works on any backend)
crabbox.sh new my-box -- bash -c 'npm install && npm test'

# islo: provision a sandbox with one or more repos cloned in
crabbox.sh new build-issue-42 \
  --source github://incredibuild/ibguard:main \
  --workdir ibguard

# islo: multi-repo fan-out (repeat --source)
crabbox.sh new cross-repo-task \
  --source github://incredibuild/api \
  --source github://incredibuild/frontend

# islo: start an agent against a task (the delegation form — REQUIRES an agent-capable backend)
crabbox.sh new refactor-auth \
  --source github://incredibuild/ibguard --workdir ibguard \
  --agent claude \
  --task "refactor the auth module to use the new token schema; open a PR"
```

**islo flags** passed through: `--agent {claude,cursor}` · `--source github://...[:branch]` (repeatable) · `--task "..."` (requires `--agent`) · `--workdir` · `--image` · `--env`/`-e KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) · `--gateway-profile` · `--snapshot NAME` · `--new-session` · `--session`/`-s NAME` · `--list-sessions` · `--run-as-user`. **`--agent`/`--task` on a non-agent backend are rejected by crabbox.sh** — use Pattern 8 instead.

**Trailing args after `--`** are the command to run inside the box (omit for an interactive shell — a last resort for Hermes; prefer the exec form).

## Cleanup safety (enforced, not just advised)

- **`crabbox.sh rm` refuses wildcards / `--all` / a missing name** and exits non-zero, so a glob can't sweep boxes you didn't create. It maps to the backend's per-box removal verb (`islo rm NAME` / `crabbox stop --id NAME`). **Never** `crabbox cleanup` — that is a fleet-wide GC sweep, takes no id, and refuses under a coordinator.
- **Always `crabbox.sh list` first** and confirm the name matches a box spawned in the current Hermes session before deleting. Other sessions/users may have parallel boxes.
- For long-lived dev boxes use `crabbox.sh pause` / `resume` (state preserved, resources freed). For ephemeral fan-out, `crabbox.sh rm NAME -f` after the PR is confirmed.

## Patterns

> Patterns 1–3 (autonomous PR creation) require an **agent-capable** backend (`islo`). Patterns 4–7 run locally via `delegate_task` (no sandbox). Pattern 8 is crabbox-native and needs no agent.

### Pattern 1 — Build a feature or fix a bug (autonomous PR) · *agent backend*

When the user says *"implement issue #42"*, *"fix this bug in repo X"*, or *"add a /health endpoint to these three repos"*:

```bash
ORG=incredibuild; REPO=ibguard; ISSUE_NUM=42
TS=$(date +%s)
SANDBOX="build-${REPO}-${ISSUE_NUM}-cursor-${TS}"
BRANCH_NAME="feat/issue-${ISSUE_NUM}-${TS}"
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" -R "$ORG/$REPO" --json title -q .title 2>/dev/null || echo "issue-${ISSUE_NUM}")
BUILD_PROMPT="Implement issue #${ISSUE_NUM} (${ISSUE_TITLE}) on branch ${BRANCH_NAME}. Read the issue, explore the codebase, plan briefly, branch from default, implement in the repo's existing style, run tests, commit with explicit file paths, and open a PR with 'Closes #${ISSUE_NUM}'."

# Pre-flight: existing PRs / branches for this issue
gh pr list -R $ORG/$REPO --search "linked:$ORG/$REPO#$ISSUE_NUM" --json number,title,state,url
gh api "repos/$ORG/$REPO/branches" --jq '.[].name' | grep -iE "(^|[^0-9])${ISSUE_NUM}([^0-9]|$)" || true

# Launch (islo)
crabbox.sh new "$SANDBOX" \
  --source "github://${ORG}/${REPO}" \
  --workdir "$REPO" \
  --agent cursor \
  --task "$BUILD_PROMPT" \
  --output json
```

The `BUILD_PROMPT` should instruct the sandbox agent to: read the issue (`gh issue view`), explore the codebase (deps, conventions, test patterns), plan briefly, branch from default, implement in the repo's existing style, run tests (`go test`/`npm test`/`pytest`/`cargo test`), commit with explicit file paths (never `git add -A`), open a PR with `Closes #N`.

**Dual mode** (long PRs, contested designs): launch two sandboxes per task in parallel — one `--agent cursor`, one `--agent claude`. First PR wins; the second adds its perspective as a review comment. Trigger when: PR > 500 lines, > 15 files, > 10 commits, or user requests it.

**Multi-repo builds:** one sandbox per repo via `&` and `wait`, each PR cross-referencing the others. Or one sandbox with multiple `--source` flags if the agent should reason across repos in a single VM.

**Polling for completion** (no reliable agent-finished signal — use the PR as the signal):

```bash
TIMEOUT=$(($(date +%s) + 1800))
DELAY=15           # start small, grow toward 60s
MAX_DELAY=60
while [ $(date +%s) -lt $TIMEOUT ]; do
  PR=$(gh pr list -R $ORG/$REPO --head "$BRANCH_NAME" --json url -q '.[0].url' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$PR" ] && { echo "PR: $PR"; break; }

  # Bail out fast if the sandbox itself died.
  # Status values (islo): starting|running|paused|stopping|stopped|failed|deleted.
  SANDBOX_STATUS=$(crabbox.sh status "$SANDBOX" --output json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.status // empty')
  case "$SANDBOX_STATUS" in
    failed|stopped|deleted)
      echo "sandbox $SANDBOX reported status=$SANDBOX_STATUS; aborting poll"; break ;;
  esac

  # +/-20% jitter so parallel pollers don't synchronize.
  JITTER=$(( (RANDOM % (DELAY * 2 / 5 + 1)) - (DELAY / 5) ))
  SLEEP=$(( DELAY + JITTER ))
  [ $SLEEP -lt 1 ] && SLEEP=1
  sleep $SLEEP

  # Exponential-ish backoff capped at MAX_DELAY.
  DELAY=$(( DELAY * 2 ))
  [ $DELAY -gt $MAX_DELAY ] && DELAY=$MAX_DELAY
done
```

After the PR is confirmed: `crabbox.sh rm "$SANDBOX" -f`.

### Pattern 2 — Review a PR · *agent backend*

Pasted PR URL → spin a sandbox per PR with the review process injected as `--task`. Sandbox agent: gathers PR context (`gh pr view`/`gh pr diff`/prior reviews/sibling repos), cleans up prior crabbox review artifacts (scorecard + inline comments + dismissed reviews matched by markers), reviews from multiple engineer perspectives (backend, frontend if .tsx/.jsx/.vue/CSS, security, devops, product, cross-repo), runs tests if possible, posts inline-first review (max 10 comments, severity-prefixed, prioritized critical > warning > suggestion > question > nitpick > praise), then a single scorecard comment, then a formal review action mapped from score: `≥4.0 APPROVE` / `3.5–3.9 COMMENT` / `<3.5 REQUEST_CHANGES`. Draft PRs always COMMENT only. Large PRs (>2000 lines or >30 files): focus on highest-risk files, skip nitpick/praise, note "Partial review — focused on highest-risk files" in scorecard.

### Pattern 3 — Refine (address PR review comments) · *agent backend*

```bash
SANDBOX="refine-${REPO}-${PR_NUM}-cursor-${TS}"
crabbox.sh new "$SANDBOX" \
  --source "github://${ORG}/${REPO}" --workdir "$REPO" \
  --agent cursor \
  --task "Read PR #${PR_NUM} on ${ORG}/${REPO}. Fetch all unresolved review comments via 'gh api repos/$ORG/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUM/comments'. Address each in a focused commit. Push to the same branch. Reply on each thread with a one-line summary. Do not merge. Do not resolve threads — leave that for the reviewer."
```

### Pattern 4 — Parallel Planner (runs locally, not in a sandbox)

Planning is read-only — use Hermes `delegate_task` workers, not `crabbox.sh new`. Spawn 5 parallel children:

| Worker | Goal | Sources |
|--------|------|---------|
| Requirements Analyst | What needs to be built | Issue body, Linear, Slack threads |
| Architecture Analyst | Where/how changes go | Codebase, dep graph, existing patterns |
| Risk & Dependencies | What could go wrong | Cross-repo search, CI configs, security surface |
| Prior Art | What's been tried before | PRs, issues, git history, abandoned branches |
| Operations | Deploy, monitor, runbook | CI/CD, Dockerfiles, monitoring, infra-as-code |

Merge into `./plans/${PLAN_ID}.md`: executive summary, requirements (P0/P1/P2/out-of-scope), architecture (current/target/files-to-modify), implementation phases (T-shirt sized), risk register, decision points, prior art, operations checklist, Linear-ready task table.

Depth: `quick` (~30s) / `deep` (~2min, default) / `exhaustive` (~5min, includes cross-repo cloning). Total time = slowest worker (parallel).

End by suggesting concrete next steps — Pattern 1 (Build) for the first phase, creating Linear issues from the breakdown, or resolving the Open Questions table.

### Pattern 5 — Triage Linear issues (read-only)

Pull issues via the Linear MCP server (`hermes mcp add linear-server` if not present) → enrich from Slack via the Slack MCP if Slack URLs are in the body → cross-reference codebase via up to 3 parallel `delegate_task` workers (one per repo group) using `git log --grep="ISL-NNN"`, `gh pr list --search "ISL-NNN"`, and reading source files. Classify: FIXED / STALE / ACTIVE / NEEDS_INFO / BLOCKED / IN_PROGRESS, with confidence HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, and a suggested action (Close / Prioritize / Assign / Investigate / Design / Defer). Output a triage report grouped by recommended action with concrete code evidence (file paths, line numbers, commit hashes). **No writes to Linear, GitHub, Slack, or filesystem.**

### Pattern 6 — Log analysis (local first)

Logs are best read locally — fetch via `terminal()` (gcloud, `gh run view`, `kubectl logs`, Logfire MCP) and summarize: error patterns, time clusters, affected users/services, suspected root cause, recommended next step. If the root cause points to a code fix, hand off to Pattern 1 (Build). If it points to a Linear issue, hand off to Pattern 5 (Triage). For an *islo agent* sandbox's logs, use `crabbox.sh logs SANDBOX --type agent --follow`; for exec stream, `--type exec`. **On the crabbox backend, `logs` addresses a RUN id (`run_<hex>`), not a box name** — pass the run id captured from the run (e.g. via `--timing-json`); it supports `--tail N` but not `--follow`/`--since` (use `crabbox attach <run-id>` to follow). Don't conflate the read and the write.

### Pattern 7 — Skill autoresearch

Search the local install (`ls ~/.hermes/skills`, `ls $HERMES_INSTALL/optional-skills`), the [Skills Hub](https://agentskills.io) (Hermes is compatible with the agentskills.io standard), and the Hermes repo (`gh search code "..." -R NousResearch/hermes-agent --filename SKILL.md`). Report which skills exist (with paths/links), the gap, and a recommendation: install existing, port from another agent platform, or write new. If write, propose a `feat(skills): add X` PR and offer to scaffold against this skill's single-file conventions (frontmatter at top in shell comments, mirrored in a `cmd_skill` heredoc).

### Pattern 8 — Remote test/run on a leased box (crabbox-native, no agent)

When *you* already hold the change (a dirty worktree, a fix in progress, a flake to reproduce) and just want cloud-grade compute for the edit-save-run loop, use the `crabbox` backend. It rsyncs your checkout to a leased box and runs the command there, exiting with the remote exit code — nothing is committed and no agent is involved.

```bash
export CRABBOX_BACKEND=crabbox

# How the wrapper invocation maps to the real crabbox CLI:
#   crabbox.sh new swift-crab -- npm test   ->  crabbox run --id swift-crab -- npm test
#   crabbox.sh new -- npm test              ->  crabbox run -- npm test   (no --id: fresh ephemeral lease, auto-released on exit)
#   crabbox.sh list --json                  ->  crabbox list --json
#   crabbox.sh rm swift-crab                 ->  crabbox stop --id swift-crab
#   crabbox.sh status swift-crab --json      ->  crabbox status --id swift-crab --json
#   crabbox.sh pause swift-crab              ->  crabbox pause --id swift-crab
#   crabbox.sh resume swift-crab             ->  crabbox resume --id swift-crab
#   crabbox.sh ssh swift-crab                ->  crabbox ssh --id swift-crab
#   crabbox.sh ports swift-crab --json       ->  crabbox ports --id swift-crab --json
#   crabbox.sh doctor --json                 ->  crabbox doctor --json
# Create a PERSISTENT/reusable named box (divergence from islo — see below):
#   crabbox warmup --slug swift-crab         (warmup keeps the lease; --keep defaults true)
# Run logs by RUN id (run_<hex>), NOT a box name:
#   crabbox logs <run-id> --json

# Run the suite on a big remote box against your local dirty checkout
crabbox.sh new ci-box -- pnpm test:changed

# Reproduce a flake on a beefy class, capturing JUnit evidence
crabbox.sh new flake-repro -- go test -run TestThatFlakes -count=20 ./...

# Run, then tear down the single lease (stop, not cleanup)
crabbox.sh new pr-smoke -- bash -c 'pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm test:integration'
crabbox.sh list --json
crabbox.sh rm pr-smoke -f       # -> crabbox stop --id pr-smoke
```

**`new NAME` ephemeral/persistent divergence from islo.** `crabbox.sh new NAME -- cmd` forwards to `crabbox run --id NAME -- cmd`. With **no** `--id` (bare `crabbox.sh new -- cmd`) crabbox creates a fresh ephemeral lease that auto-releases on exit. The `--` separator is **mandatory**; everything after it is the remote command sent verbatim as argv (never a box id). To create a **durable** named box, use `crabbox warmup --slug NAME` (the safest "make a reusable box" mapping) or `crabbox run --keep --slug NAME` — a bare `run` will not persist.

**Logs are run-scoped on crabbox.** `crabbox logs` addresses a **RUN id** (`run_<hex>`), not a box/lease id, so `crabbox.sh logs NAME` (NAME = box) does **not** map cleanly — the wrapper forwards `logs` verbatim without `--id` injection. Capture the run id from the preceding run (e.g. via `--timing-json`) and pass it to `crabbox logs <run-id>`. `logs` supports `--tail N` but **not** `--follow`/`--since`; live following is the separate `crabbox attach <run-id>`. Logs/results/events also require a configured broker/coordinator — direct-provider runs aren't recorded, so fall back to `--capture-stdout`/`--capture-stderr`/`--timing-json` on `run` for direct-mode evidence.

**Pause/resume are provider-gated.** Supported on islo and codesandbox; others return "provider does not support pause/resume". Docker Sandbox supports neither, and its `stop` is destructive (`sbx rm --force`). Surface the provider error rather than assuming success.

This is complementary to Patterns 1–3: islo sends an agent to *write* a PR; crabbox gives you a remote box to *run* code you already have. When a Build sandbox can't reproduce an environment-specific failure, hand the diff to a crabbox box with production-like tooling.

## Best practices

- **Unique box names** with a timestamp suffix (`${prefix}-${repo}-${id}-${agent}-${ts}`) so parallel work doesn't collide.
- **`crabbox.sh init` once per project** to drop the backend config — the wizard can interfere with `--task` startup if no config exists.
- **`-- COMMAND` for one-shots**, interactive shell only when truly interactive (debugging). Hermes can parse machine-readable exit codes from the exec form; PTY shells are noise to parse.
- **`--env` over `--gateway-profile` for casual env vars** (islo); reserve `--gateway-profile` for repeatable network/credential policy.
- **`--snapshot NAME`** (islo) to restore from a known-good VM state (faster cold start, shared base image).
- **`crabbox.sh pause` between bursts**, not `stop` — pause snapshots and frees resources, resume is fast.
- **Sandbox/box environments lack production parity** — integration tests needing real DBs, external APIs, or org-private credentials will skip; the sandbox agent should call this out in the PR description.
- **Merge conflicts** between parallel build sandboxes targeting the same repo — leave for the human reviewer; don't auto-resolve from the orchestrator.

## Reporting

After every fan-out, Hermes reports back:

- Box name(s) and a link to the backend's web dashboard (islo: `https://app.islo.dev`). The exact per-box deep-link path isn't part of the wrapper contract — report the dashboard root plus the name.
- What each box is working on.
- PR URL(s) once available — or box names + the `crabbox.sh logs NAME --type agent --tail 50` hint if the timeout fires.

For long fan-outs from the messaging gateway, schedule a notification on PR creation and let the user keep their TUI free.

## Integration credentials

`crabbox.sh login --tool {github,gitlab,slack,claude,anthropic}` connects an integration via OAuth — credentials are injected into boxes whose gateway-profile permits them. Never echo these tokens in Hermes output. The sandbox agent uses `gh` (auto-authed via the integration) for GitHub work; mirror this for GitLab/Slack/etc.

## Known limitations

1. **No reliable completion API (islo)** — poll for the PR on the expected branch; `status` is for liveness, not done-ness; `logs --type agent --follow` for a liveness signal.
2. **`--agent claude` doesn't pin Opus vs Sonnet** — controlled by Anthropic integration settings, not the CLI flag.
3. **`--agent`/`--task` need an agent-capable backend** — crabbox.sh rejects them on `crabbox` (not agent-capable; `crabbox code` is a code-server VS Code bridge, not an AI agent). Switch to `islo` (or another agent backend).
4. **Box environments lack production parity** — flag skipped integration tests in PRs.
5. **No backend config in cwd** races the setup wizard with `--task` startup. Fix: `crabbox.sh init` first.
6. **`crabbox.sh rm`** is wildcard-guarded but still has no recycle bin. Always `crabbox.sh list` first; remove only names this session created.
7. **Cross-org `gh` search** sees only what the auth token can access — private repos in other orgs won't appear.
8. **Only `new`/`list`/`rm`/`schema` + box addressing are normalized across backends** — other verbs forward verbatim, so a verb a backend lacks surfaces that backend's own error. crabbox addresses boxes by `--id NAME` (injected for single-box verbs); islo uses positional names. `crabbox logs` takes a RUN id (`run_<hex>`), not a box name, and isn't `--id`-injected. Run `crabbox.sh backends` / `schema <cmd>` when unsure.
10. **crabbox `rm`→`stop`, never `cleanup`** — `stop` ends ONE lease (`crabbox stop --id NAME`; `release` is a compat alias). `cleanup` is a fleet-wide GC sweep that takes no id and refuses under a coordinator — wrong/unsafe for per-box teardown.
11. **crabbox is NOT agent-capable and NOT schema-capable** — `crabbox code` is a code-server browser bridge, not an autonomous agent; `--agent`/`--task` are rejected, and `schema` is stubbed (use per-command `--json`, `providers --json`, `config show --json`).
9. **Native Windows is unsupported** — use WSL2.

## Why single-file?

- **One install path** — copy `crabbox.sh` and you have the skill, the CLI, and the docs.
- **One discovery path** — Hermes finds the script at `optional-skills/autonomous-ai-agents/crabbox/crabbox.sh`; loaders that prefer SKILL.md can `./crabbox.sh skill > SKILL.md` to materialize one.
- **Backend-agnostic** — `CRABBOX_BACKEND` selects the sandbox CLI; verb names and capabilities are declared in `load_backend` (islo and openclaw/crabbox ship in the box).
- **Auditable** — the wrapper is a screenful of shell: a backend table, three guards, one dispatch. No opaque transport layer.

- `codex` skill — same, for OpenAI Codex
- `blackbox`, `honcho` — sibling delegation skills under `optional-skills/autonomous-ai-agents/`
- `github-pr-workflow` skill — PR mechanics that don't need a sandbox
- Hermes `delegate_task` tool — in-process subagent fan-out (read-only investigation, planning)

crabbox.sh's value over local-CLI delegation is *cloud execution in isolated boxes* — with islo, parallel agents that return PRs; with openclaw/crabbox, a remote box for your own dirty checkout. Use local-CLI delegation when work is small, trusted, or read-only.

## Self-documentation hook

When in doubt about a flag, **don't guess** — call `crabbox.sh schema <command>` and parse the output. islo ships a machine-readable schema for AI agents; crabbox is not schema-capable, so the wrapper stubs `schema` (exit 2) and prints `--help` for orientation only — for crabbox discovery use per-command `--json`, `crabbox providers --json`, and `crabbox config show --json`. This skill describes patterns, not flag minutiae.
