# Genie — VPS Disk Cleanup

Safely reclaims disk space on Linux VPS and workstations by deleting or compressing stale state snapshots, logs, cron output, temp files, and package caches. Does not touch live databases, auth files, or active sessions.

## When to Use

- VPS disk usage is high (above 50%)
- User asks to "clean up disk space" or "check disk usage"
- Weekly maintenance cron fires
- Before/after large operations (backups, migrations)

## Prerequisites

No external dependencies — uses only Python 3.11+ stdlib.

Optional: set `GENIE_*` environment variables to override defaults (see Configuration below).

## How to Run

```bash
# Assess disk usage and identify cleanup targets
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py --assess

# Execute cleanup (Tier 1 + Tier 2)
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py --clean

# Dry run — preview without deleting
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py --clean --dry-run

# Map filesystem and generate FILESYSTEM.md manifest
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py --discover
```

For large file counts (>2,000), run in background: `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)`.

## Quick Reference

| Flag | Action |
|------|--------|
| `--assess` | Report disk usage and cleanup targets |
| `--clean` | Execute Tier 1 + Tier 2 cleanup |
| `--clean --tier 1` | Only Tier 1 (zero risk) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without modifying anything |
| `--discover` | Map filesystem, create/update FILESYSTEM.md |
| `--analyze` | Tier 3 analysis only (read-only) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Procedure

1. **Locate the script** — check these paths in order:
   - `/root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py` (profile)
   - `/root/.hermes/skills/genie/scripts/genie.py` (skill-bundled)
   - Use absolute paths only — never `~` in cron context

2. **Assess** — run `--assess` to identify targets

3. **Execute** — run `--clean` (or `--clean --dry-run` to preview)

4. **Report** — verify with `df -h /` after cleanup

## Safety Rules

- NEVER modify `state.db` directly — Tier 3 analysis only
- NEVER delete files without compressing first (Tier 2+)
- ALWAYS report what was done
- If disk usage is below 50%, report "no action needed"
- If any operation fails, report the error and continue
- If a snapshot deletion fails, leave the snapshot in place and report at the end
- The most recent snapshot is always preserved (never auto-deleted)

## Error Handling

- **gzip failures:** If `gzip -t` reports a `.gz` is corrupt but the original exists, keep the original and regenerate. Never delete the original while the gzip is corrupt.
- **Concurrent gzip race:** Only one gzip per file. A timed-out foreground command can leave a background shell that spawns a second gzip. Verify with `gzip -t`, then remove the original.
- **Disk-at-100%:** Focus on immediate space recovery (Tier 1 cleanup) before any backup workflow.
- **Snapshot deletion failure:** Leave the snapshot in place, report the error, continue to next target.

## What Genie Cleans

### Tier 1 — Zero Risk (auto-executed)
1. **Stale state snapshots** — directories older than 7 days (most recent always preserved)
2. **Old log files** — compress after 7 days, delete compressed after 30 days
3. **Old cron output** — compress after 7 days
4. **Stale `/tmp` files** — delete after 24 hours
5. **Package caches** — pip, uv, npm (all rebuildable)

### Tier 2 — Low Risk (requires confirmation)
1. **Session JSON duplicates** — compress after 14 days (data also in `state.db`)

### Tier 3 — Analysis Only (never auto-executes)
1. **state.db bloat analysis** — reports DB size, freelist waste
2. **Large directories** — reports git checkpoints, commons/data, commons/db for manual review

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GENIE_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | 7 | Delete snapshots older than N days |
| `GENIE_LOG_COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS` | 7 | Compress logs older than N days |
| `GENIE_LOG_DELETE_AGE_DAYS` | 30 | Delete compressed logs older than N days |
| `GENIE_CRON_OUTPUT_COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS` | 7 | Compress cron output older than N days |
| `GENIE_SESSION_COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS` | 14 | Compress session JSONs older than N days |
| `GENIE_TMP_STALE_HOURS` | 24 | Delete /tmp files older than N hours (0 to skip) |
| `GENIE_DRY_RUN` | false | If true, only report — don't delete/compress |

## Verification

- `df -h /` — check disk usage dropped
- `du -sh /root/.hermes/` — check .hermes size
- Session search still works (confirms state.db intact)
